		<p>Karien is an advocate for openness and supporter of social entrepreneurs. She has played various roles within the Foundation, facing new challenges and learning every step of the way. She now focusses on the Fellowship Program - engaging with issues of openness and social change, identifying potential investments and working closely with Fellows towards realising their vision.</p>
		<p>She is a native of the Eastern Cape, South Africa, and the smell of rain after a dry spell still makes her think of home. She believes elephants have noble hearts and is passionate about their protection and conservation. It is rare for a meme to pass her by, she always knows what's up in the collective mind of the Internet. </p>
		<p>Karien studied business and economics at the business schools of the University of Stellenbosch and University of Cape Town. </p>
